        <h1>Tun Syed Nasir Inventory for Student</h1>
        <p class="lead">
            Tun Syed Nasir residential college is the oldest in UTHM. For student convenience, TSN provide a storage room
            room for the student to keep their extra belogings when semester break. This is to reduce the load of the student so that they do not have
            to pack everything home every time semester break. Thus, this inventory system is solely for the student to register their items that they want to store.
